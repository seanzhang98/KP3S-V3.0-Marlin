# KP3S-V3.0-Marlin
Marlin Firmware for Kingroon KP3S V3.0 (GD32 F303) (No BLtouch Support)

Beacuse Marlin have not offically support GD32 F303 Chip board and BLtouch seens like not working AT ALL on this board, so there are no support for BLtouch with this firmware.

Features:
- Runout detection
- Manual Bed Leveling
- Printer status
- Nice looking Color Theme
